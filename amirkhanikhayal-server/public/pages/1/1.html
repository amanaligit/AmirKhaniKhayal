                artist of
                <b><i>khayal gayaki</i></b>. Without any controversy, it can be stated that along with being a
                successful
                vocalist, he was a thinker, an innovator in the field of music, a setter of new trends, and also having
                an
                attractive and handsome personality. He provided to <b><i>Khayal </i></b>style such a peculiar format,
                which
                proved to be very effective and popular.</font>

                and

                those, who follow him. Who do not follow him; it is difficult for them also to ignore him. Ustad Amir
                Khan’s
                contribution is acknowledged as a link between the old conventions of classical music and new values. As
                per
                his name, he was ‘prosperous’ [<b><i>Amir</i></b>] of genius and imagination, based on aesthetic sense.
                He
                is considered as an artist of artists.</font>

                        recollections, scattered here and there, could not fulfill this purpose. Therefore, I made
                        humble
                        attempt to fulfill this void from 1988 to 1993.<span> From 1986, I am disciple of well known
                            classical vocalist, Acharya Goswami Gokulotsavji Mahara<strong>j </strong>of Indore. Since
                            then,
                            I am receiving guidance in <strong><i>Khayal</i> </strong>and<strong> <i>Tarana</i>
                            </strong>style from him. Goswamiji is influenced by the style of Ustad Amir Khan. Therefore,
                            I
                            got an opportunity to receive training of <b><i>Khayal</i></b> and <b><i>Tarana</i></b>
                            styles
                            on that pattern. In my research work, this training was very much helpful to me in analyzing
                            that style minutely. I am thankful to him for the same.</span></font>
