<p>Ustad Amir Khan was an internationally acclaimed artist of khayal gayaki. Without any controversy, it
    can be stated that along with being a successful vocalist, he was a thinker, an innovator in the
    field of music, a setter of new trends, and also having an attractive and handsome personality. He
    provided to Khayal style such a peculiar format, which proved to be very effective and popular.</p>
<p>He achieved big successes in his life. His disciples and fans and experts, who came in his contact,
    bear witness to his valuable contribution. Though today he is not present amongst us physically, his
    existence is experienced. The real time of a great man is that, when he survives only by virtue of
    his work and its impact on coming generations.</p>
<p>In the world of music, Ustad Amir Khan is an ideal for those, who follow him. Who do not follow him;
    it is difficult for them also to ignore him. Ustad Amir Khan&rsquo;s contribution is acknowledged as
    a link between the old conventions of classical music and new values. As per his name, he was
    &lsquo;prosperous&rsquo; [Amir] of genius and imagination, based on aesthetic sense. He is considered
    as an artist of artists.</p>
<p>Even today Performances of Khan Saheb are preserved in the form of gramophone records, audio cassettes
    and CDs, and are available for desiring listeners. It is hoped that it will remain available in
    distant future also. The present and coming generations can enjoy by listening to it, and intelligent
    students of music can also take guidance from it in development of their singing style. Nevertheless,
    no authentic book has been written based on facts, determined after total investigations and research
    about him, which throws light on his style. Before my research project, the information provided in
    publications and in individual recollections, scattered here and there, could not fulfill this
    purpose. Therefore, I made humble attempt to fulfill this void from 1988 to 1993. From 1986, I am
    disciple of well known classical vocalist, Acharya Goswami Gokulotsavji Maharaj of Indore. Since
    then, I am receiving guidance in Khayal and Tarana style from him. Goswamiji is influenced by the
    style of Ustad Amir Khan. Therefore, I got an opportunity to receive training of Khayal and Tarana
    styles on that pattern. In my research work, this training was very much helpful to me in analyzing
    that style minutely. I am thankful to him for the same.</p>
<p>The result was that Vikram University, Ujjain [M. P.] conferred on me the degree of Ph. D. Music in
    1993. Thereafter, my research work has been published in the form of book, in the year 2000, for the
    benefit of curious lovers of music. Vikram University had given a grant under the scheme of the
    University Grant Commission, and it was published in Hindi by Classical Publishing Company, New
    Delhi.</p>
<p>Now I am enjoying great pleasure to make available my important findings for the curious readers and
    searchers in the world of internet. I welcome your feedback, as it will increase this pleasure.</p>
