    <p>At the early age of ten, Amir Khan started receiving training from his father,
        Shahmir Khan. Though Shahmir Khan himself was an established Sarangi player, he
        wanted to make his son a vocalist. Though Shahmir Khan was professionally a
        Sarangi and vina player, he had studied art of singing also along with
        instrumental. His </span><b><i>guru</i></b><span>
            [teacher], Chhange Khan, was a vocalist,
            who was his father. From the very childhood, Amir Khan’s grasping power was
            adequately developed. Whatever he had opportunity to listen, vocal or instrumental,
            and whatever </span><b><i>swara</i>
        </b><span>phrases
            taught by his father, he had wonderful
            capability to reproduce it instantly.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align:justify">
        <font color="#000000" face="times new roman, serif" size="3">During
            this period of initial training, Shahmir Khan started to make him practice of <b><i>paltas</i></b>
            [permutations] based on <b><i>meru khand</i></b> system, which is very hard and
            complex method. Thus, it was but natural that at that early age, such practice
            seemed to be boring to Amir Khan. Except the training given by father, to hear
            or sing anything else was prohibited. In this context, a recollection narrated
            by his younger brother, Bashir Khan, is worth mentioning.</font>

    <p style="text-align:justify">
        <font color="#000000" face="times new roman, serif" size="3">“Father
            started giving training to brother, Amir Khan. From the very first day, he
            persisted for preparation of <b><i>meru khand</i></b>. To sing anything else
            was not allowed. In total, 5040s <i>tans</i> were taught and were got crammed.
            Brother used to get annoyed very much. A drama company had come to Indore. Whole of the city
            was <a name="OLE_LINK17"></a>crooning its songs. But brother was to keep away from
            every thing except <b><i>khand meru</i></b>. When father went for Namaz [prayer
            of Muslims], brother used to croon songs of Marathi dramas. Once he was caught
            and was beaten severely.”<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ednref1"

    <p style="text-align:justify">
        <font color="#000000" face="times new roman, serif" size="3">On
            attainment of adolescence, the physical process of breaking of voice began. The
            voice was not fit for singing in such condition. Then Amir Khan thought that <a
                name="OLE_LINK19"></a>botheration
            of practice to sing was now over. As is generally seen, at this
            stage, practice of singing is halted for one or two years. But Shahmir Khan
            took advantage of this period by handing over Sarangi to Amir Khan, as per rich
            tradition of Sarangi playing in his family. Being a genius, he began playing
            Sarangi skillfully in a very short time. He wanted to take down on Sarangi,
            every <b><i>swara</i> </b>phrase which he had learnt during his training of
            vocalism. According to Bashir Khan, Amir Khan was a good Sarangi player, this
            fact is known to very few people. He was not satisfied himself by this progress
            achieved in Sarangi playing. Because of being ambitious, it seemed to him that
            to become a vocalist would be a right aim for him. The reasons which were in
            the back ground of his mentality are worth noting.</font>

    <p style="text-align:justify">
        <font color="#000000" face="times new roman, serif" size="3">During
            training of Sarangi playing by father, Shahmir Khan, Amir Khan had bitter
            experience of father’s short temperament. Such behavior of his father was just
            in conformity with the behavior of <b><i>Ustads</i></b><i> </i>of those times.
            Amir Khan’s close friend and Sitar player, Mr. Ramnath Shrivastava, who&nbsp; himself was also learning
            Sarangi playing
            along with Amir Khan from Shahmir Khan, have expressed his recollection: -</font>

    <p style="text-align:justify">
        <font color="#000000" face="times new roman, serif" size="3">“In
            childhood, we both learned together Sarangi from Shahmir Khan. Once, on
            incorrect playing, his father [Shahmir Khan] struck forcefully on his neck with
            a box. Then Amir Khan proceeded towards vocalism leaving Sarangi.”<a href="javascript:void(0);"

    <p style="text-align:justify">
        <font color="#000000" face="times new roman, serif" size="3">By
            this event, Amir Khan was so much affected that he decided to become a
            vocalist. For this, he got support of his younger brother. In beginning, he
            started practice of vocal in secret, in which Bashir Khan gave him
            accompaniment on Sarangi. During training of Sarangi playing from his father,
            he used to learn <b><i>gayaki ang</i> </b>[instrumental technique similar to
            vocalism] and specialties of <b><i>raga</i></b><i>s</i>. This knowledge helped
            him in practice of vocal.</font>

    <p style="text-align:justify">
        <font color="#000000" face="times new roman, serif" size="3">In
            another context, Amir Khan had to face an insult for being son of a Sarangi
            player, which made firm his determination to become a vocalist. Giving account
            of this event, a famous harmonium player of Indore,
            Mr. Bapurao Agnihotri has written: “Once in Indore, at a street called Gafoor Ki
            Bajariya, a music program was held. At the time of Maharaja Tukojirao Holkar [3<sup>rd</sup></font><span

            Nasiruddin Khan Dagar was his court musician. It is said that at the

                khand</i></b><span>,
            and he took it and started reading; but Nasiruddin snatched the
            book from him saying that it was of no use for a child like him. Amir Khan was
            deeply hurt by these insulting words and then and there he decided that in any
            way he would become a vocalist of high standard. So what was to do then! He
            asked his friend Ramnath to bring that book from anywhere and Mr. Ramnathji
            Shrivastava [of India Hotel], who was his close friend, copied the book within
            few days by his own hand and gave it to Amir Khan.”</span><a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ednref3"

    <p style="text-align:justify">
        <font color="#000000" face="times new roman, serif" size="3">Acharya
            Brihaspati has also narrated an incident of similar type in this way: “Amir
            Khan was a child at that time. At that time, a very eminent <b><i>dhrupad</i></b>
            singer lived at Indore.
            One day, he was teaching <b><i>paltas</i></b> [permutations] of <b><i>khand
                    meru</i></b> to students of his family. Amir Khan reached there coincidently
            and the subject was changed. How could practice of <b><i>khand meru</i></b><i> </i>be
            carried on in the presence of son of a Sarangi player? Amir Khan, even though a
            child, could understand actual thing and was deeply hurt.”<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ednref4"
                title=""><span><span>[4]</span></span></a></font>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify">
        <font color="#000000" face="times new roman, serif" size="3">By
            this event, Amir Khan evidently realized that depending upon ‘Sarangi’, an
            instrument associated with infamous persons and considered suitable only for
            accompaniment; no honorable place could be achieved in the society and among
            artists. He saw that his predecessors, two great artists of Kirana Gharana,
            Ustad Abdul Karim Khan and Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan, though originally trained as
            Sarangi players, proceeded in the field of vocalism and earned name as founders
            of a <b><i>gharana</i></b> of vocal music that is Kirana Gharana. Accordingly,
            Amir Khan left Sarangi playing and started his endeavor to become a vocalist
            and subsequently became famous as a founder of Indore Gharana.</font>

        <font color="#000000" face="times new roman, serif" size="3"><b><i>Alap, behlava, meed, gamak, tans,
                    khatka</i></b> etc elements which are applied for embellishment of a
            <b><i>raga</i> </b>have almost similar form, both in Sarangi playing and in
            vocalism. Hence, it was not difficult for Amir Khan to enter into one field
            leaving the other. The first aim before him was to culture the voice suitable
            to the desired style. Besides, there is tremendous scope for expression of
            sentiments in vocal, in comparison to any instrument. Probably that is why, in
            the three modes of music [vocal, instrumental and dance], vocal is ranked as
            first.</font>

        <font color="#000000" face="times new roman, serif" size="3">In
            early age [ten years], when Amir Khan’s initial training started, at that time
            he was made to practice of singing for a very short duration; but as he started
            entering adulthood, the duration of his practice started increasing. In an
            interview, he himself says: -</font>

        <font color="#000000" face="times new roman, serif" size="3">“My
            training started at the age of ten from my father. I was young; he made me sing
            for half or one hour. He made me sing for an hour each in morning, in afternoon
            and in evening for years together. Afterwards I came to understand. I
            questioned him one day, why you ask me to sing for an hour only? He said: ‘it
            is not right to sing more at present. The mind will not be able to respond for
            the purity of the <b><i>swaras</i> </b>by practicing more; hence, sing less
            now’. This process continued till 1937, that is, till the death of father.”<a href="javascript:void(0);"
