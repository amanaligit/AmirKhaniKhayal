    <p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt">Late Ustad Amir Khan, the founder of <b><i>Indore Gharana,
            </i></b>was dynamic person having talent with multiple dimensions. In addition to being a top vocalist,
        he was a sober man of <b><i>Sufi</i> </b>temperament. His contemplation was so deep rooted that he occupies
        a unique place in the <b><i>gayaki</i> </b>of every vocalist of today.

    <p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt">
        It has been the quality of his <b><i>gayaki</i></b>, that
        his vocalism was not merely a demonstration but it was real form of philosophy. <b><i>Khayal</i> </b>is a
        meditation, <b><i>Dhyan-yoga</i></b>, and imagination generated from it, which is reflected every moment and
        manifests its existence in his singing. Probably, his inclination towards philosophy brought him near the
        literature, replete with philosophy of our <b><i>Vallabh</i></b> sect and <b><i>Pushti Marg. </i></b>As the
        nature of water is cool, howsoever hot it may be made, it becomes cool again. Similarly, with inclusion of
        all aspects, effortlessness is the permanent characteristic of his vocalism. The ease and soberness of his
        <b><i>gayaki</i> </b>enabled the <b><i>khayal</i> </b>singers with that culture [<b><i>Tehzeeb</i></b>]
        again, which should be expected from the form, considered to be classical and traditional. This publication
        is to bring in light the personality and his contribution, occupying the place of mile stone in the history
        of Indian Classical Music. This is the best utilization of high quality research work and dissertation.

        Not focusing only on the biography of Ustad Amir Khan, the
        specialty of this publication is that it analyses every possible aspect of his vocal style and provides
        balanced comments to arrive at proper conclusions. It is an able Endeavour to express in words, the
        specialty of <b><i>swara</i> </b>salient Expressive style.

        It would be appropriate to mention about author of this book also. Dr. Ibrahim Ali has
        been receiving <b><i>talim</i></b> [training] in <b><i>khayal gayaki</i></b> from me since 1986. The
        capability he has acquired in practical aspect of music vocal, so we should hope for his bright future.
        There has been shortage of contribution of creative writing amongst artists themselves in India. Hence,
        I consider it as a good sign in this direction. If artists themselves write in the subject of music,
        then it makes possible to communicate authentically both aspects, musical expression and its impression;
        because along with practical presentation, it is natural for an artist to be a wise listener. Probably
        it would be the reason for success of this publication.
